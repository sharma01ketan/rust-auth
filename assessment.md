# **Objective**

Build a Rust backend API for a simple task management workflow. The goal is to test authentication, two-factor login, role-based permissions, task assignment, caching, and clean backend structure.

**AI tools are allowed. We do not mind how the candidate builds it, but they must understand and explain the submitted code.**

# **Required Workflow**

When the API is running locally, we should be able to complete this flow using curl, Postman, or Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

1. Create two users: Admin and James Bond.  
2. Start login as Admin using email and password. The API should trigger a two-factor email code and return a login\_challenge\_id, not a JWT.  
3. Retrieve the verification code from a local development email log or console output.  
4. Verify Admin 2FA and receive an Admin JWT token.  
5. Create exactly 5 tasks as Admin.  
6. Assign exactly 3 of those tasks to James Bond.  
7. Start login as James Bond and retrieve his two-factor verification code.  
8. Verify James Bond 2FA and receive a James Bond JWT token.  
9. Attempt to create a task as James Bond. This must return 403 Forbidden.  
10. Call GET /tasks/view-my-tasks as James Bond. It must return exactly 3 assigned tasks.  
11. Call GET /tasks/view-my-tasks again. The response should come from cache and show cache.hit \= true.

# **Expected API Shape**

The exact route names can vary slightly, but the following capabilities must exist.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| POST /seed/users | Create Admin and James Bond users for validation. |
| POST /auth/login | Validate email/password, create a 2FA challenge, and trigger an email code. |
| GET /dev/email-logs/latest | Development-only endpoint to view the latest sent verification code. |
| POST /auth/verify-2fa | Verify the code and return a JWT access token. |
| POST /tasks | Create a task. Admin only. |
| POST /tasks/assign | Assign selected tasks to James Bond. Admin only. |
| GET /tasks/view-my-tasks | Return tasks assigned to the logged-in user, with cache metadata. |

# **Final Validation Response**

The main validation point is the final James Bond response. If this response is correct, we can quickly confirm that the core assignment works.

GET /tasks/view-my-tasks  
Authorization: Bearer JAMES\_BOND\_TOKEN

Expected response:  
{  
  "user": {  
    "email": "jamesbond@example.com",  
    "role": "staff"  
  },  
  "tasks": \[  
    {  
      "id": "...",  
      "title": "...",  
      "status": "todo",  
      "priority": "high",  
      "assigned\_to": "jamesbond@example.com"  
    },  
    {  
      "id": "...",  
      "title": "...",  
      "status": "todo",  
      "priority": "medium",  
      "assigned\_to": "jamesbond@example.com"  
    },  
    {  
      "id": "...",  
      "title": "...",  
      "status": "todo",  
      "priority": "low",  
      "assigned\_to": "jamesbond@example.com"  
    }  
  \],  
  "summary": {  
    "total\_assigned\_tasks": 3  
  },  
  "cache": {  
    "hit": false  
  }  
}

Calling the same endpoint again should return cache.hit \= true.

# **Minimum Data Model**

Candidates may design the data model however they prefer, but the implementation should support at least these entities:

* User  
* Task  
* LoginChallenge or TwoFactorChallenge  
* EmailLog or equivalent development email record

A user should include: id, full\_name, email, hashed\_password, role, created\_at, updated\_at.

A task should include: id, title, description, status, priority, created\_by\_id, assigned\_to\_id, created\_at, updated\_at.

# **Business Rules**

* Users have roles: admin or staff.  
* Only Admin can create tasks.  
* Only Admin can assign tasks.  
* James Bond must not be able to create tasks.  
* James Bond must only see tasks assigned to him.  
* Exactly 5 tasks must be created during the validation flow.  
* Exactly 3 tasks must be assigned to James Bond.  
* The view-my-tasks response must be generated from the database, not hardcoded.

# **Two-Factor Authentication Requirement**

Login must use email-based two-factor authentication. The first login request should not return a JWT immediately. It should create a challenge, generate a one-time code, and trigger an email event.

* Verification codes expire after 5 minutes.  
* Verification codes can only be used once.  
* Incorrect and expired codes must be rejected.  
* A JWT is issued only after successful verification.  
* Real email delivery is optional. SMTP, Mailtrap, console logging, or an email\_logs table are acceptable.  
* If persisted, the verification code should not be stored in plain text.

# **Caching Requirement**

The GET /tasks/view-my-tasks endpoint must use caching per user.

* The first request should load from the database and return cache.hit \= false.  
* The second identical request should return from cache and return cache.hit \= true.  
* When tasks are assigned or updated, the affected user task cache must be invalidated.  
* Redis is preferred. In-memory cache is acceptable if the limitation is documented.

# **Rust Technical Requirements**

Use Rust and a production-appropriate web API stack. Suggested options:

* Rust stable edition 2021 or later  
* Axum or Actix Web  
* SQLx, SeaORM, or Diesel  
* PostgreSQL preferred; SQLite acceptable for local development  
* JWT authentication  
* Argon2 or bcrypt password hashing  
* Serde for request/response models  
* Tokio async runtime  
* Migrations using sqlx-cli, refinery, Diesel migrations, or equivalent  
* Tests using cargo test plus integration tests where appropriate

Optional: Docker Compose, Redis, OpenAPI generation, tracing/logging, rustfmt, clippy, GitHub Actions.

# **Testing Expectations**

* Admin and James Bond can be created.  
* Login creates a 2FA challenge and does not immediately return a JWT.  
* Correct 2FA code returns a JWT.  
* Incorrect, expired, or reused 2FA codes are rejected.  
* Admin can create 5 tasks.  
* Admin can assign exactly 3 tasks to James Bond.  
* James Bond cannot create a task.  
* James Bond can view exactly 3 assigned tasks.  
* Calling view-my-tasks twice shows cache.hit false, then true.  
* Task assignment/update invalidates the affected cache.

# **Submission Requirements**

* GitHub repository link  
* README.md with setup, migration, run, seed, validation, and test instructions  
* AI\_USAGE.md explaining which AI tools were used and what was manually changed  
* .env.example  
* Application code, migrations, and tests  
* The final GET /tasks/view-my-tasks response pasted into the README

# **Assumptions Candidates Can Make**

* This is a local development assignment, not a deployed production service.  
* A simple seed endpoint or seed script is acceptable for creating Admin and James Bond.  
* Real email delivery is not required if email events can be validated locally.  
* In-memory caching is acceptable if Redis is not used, but it must be documented.  
* Task statuses and priorities can be simple enums or constrained strings.  
* No frontend is required.  
* The API can use UUIDs or integer IDs.  
* The exact folder structure is up to the candidate, as long as it is clean and maintainable.  
* It is acceptable to make small route-name changes if the README clearly documents the validation workflow.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

* The required workflow works end to end.  
* Authentication, 2FA, and JWT handling are implemented correctly.  
* Role-based permissions are enforced.  
* Caching works and invalidates correctly.  
* James Bond sees exactly 3 assigned tasks and cannot create tasks.  
* The code is idiomatic, maintainable Rust.  
* Tests cover the core workflow.  
* The candidate can explain their design and AI usage.
- hey, i am the solver here, basic things which i want to tell
- no redis will be used, we will use in memory caching
- please use sqlite instead of postgres sql in this
- WE WILL NOT BE USING EMAIL CLIENT
